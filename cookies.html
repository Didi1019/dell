                <p class="rbRG16">This Cookie Notice (“Notice”) explains how Dell and our partners, including third party advertisers and vendors, use cookies and other similar tracking technologies when you use our websites, applications, newsletters, and other online products and services that link to this policy (“Services”). This Notice provides details about your choices with respect to cookies and other similar technologies, and is a part of Dell’s Privacy Statement.                </p>

                <p class="rbRG16">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our website and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our website and Services. Cookies can be set by the site or service you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or by a third party, such as analytics or advertising services (“third-party cookies”). Third parties may collect and use information as we have described in this Notice and our Privacy Statement and pursuant to their own privacy policies.</p>
                <div>
                    <span class="rbRG16">There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</span>
                    <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Session Cookies.</i> exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the website and services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our website and services.</p>
                    <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16"> Persistent Cookies.</i> Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use per sistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="rbRG16">Dell Services use first-party and third-party cookies that fall into the following categories:</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i>Essential Cookies</i> are necessary for our Services to function properly and securely.  These cookies are essential for enabling user movement around our website and providing access to features such as your profile and purchases, log in credentials, and other areas of the website.  These cookies are necessary to enable the basic features of this site to function, such as providing secure log-in, allowing images to load, or allowing you to select your cookie preferences.  This category of cookies cannot be disabled. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but doing so means some parts of the Services will not work.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i>Marketing Cookies</i> are used to understand user behavior across our websites.  These cookies are also used to show ads that are more relevant to your interests.  We may share this information with advertising platform to help us display the most relevant messages to you.  These cookies may also store information on user behavior obtained through their browsing habits, which allows us to develop a specific profile and display advertisements appropriate to your profile.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i>Statistical Cookies</i> help us to understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information.  Any information collected by means of this type of cookie is used to measure activity on any website, application, or platform for the purposes of introducing improvements in function of the analysis of the data regarding the service use made by users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="rzSB20uc">What are cookies and how are they used?</h3>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Disabling Cookies via Browser Controls.</i>Most web browsers automatically alert you to the use of cookies. Depending on your preferences, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our website and services who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the website, but some features may not function properly.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Flash Local Storage Objects.</i>We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your website preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags and Other Technologie.</i>Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web and application pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our website and services to, among other things, track the activities of website visitors and application users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about website usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Cross-Device Use.</i>We and our third party service providers, including Google, may use the information that we collect about you (whether directly from our website, from our mobile applications, through your device(s), or from a third party) to help us and our third party service providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer, etc.). We, and our third party service providers also may use the cross-device use and other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your devices and to send you emails. To opt-out of cross-device advertising, you may follow the instructions set forth in the Third Party Ad Networks section below. Please note:  if you opt-out of these targeted advertising cookies, your opt-out will be specific to the web browser, application, or device from which you accessed the opt-out. If you use multiple devices or web browsers, you will need to opt-out each browser or device that you use.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Do-Not-Track.</i>With the exception of the Global Privacy Control noted below, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests at this time. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Networks section.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Global Privacy Control.</i>California residents can turn on the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information for each participating browser system that you use. Learn more at the Global Privacy Control website.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Third Party Ad Networks.</i>From time to time, we may provide these unaffiliated advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.  We use these network advertisers to provide advertisements on our website, application, and on other parties’ websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). Our shared use of your information with these advertisers enables us to target which products and services you may be most will be of most interest to you. Non-affiliated ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. Other parties’ cookies and technologies are governed by each company's specific privacy policy, not this one.</p>
                <p class="rbRG16"><i class="rbBL16">Ads and Email.</i> Dell and our partners may use information about your visit to this and other websites. The information could include pages you visit, the items you view or place in your shopping cart, or your responses to our ads and emails. This information allows us to make the Dell ads you see more relevant to you. This is referred to as interest-based advertising. For example, if you recently looked at laptops online, you may be more likely to see an advertisement regarding a Dell laptop. For this purpose, Dell has selected partners who are members of self-regulatory associations such as, the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).</p>
                <p class="rbRG16">To enable you to opt-out of interest-based advertising delivered by partners working with Dell, or to customise your experience on Dell websites, please visit Dell’s Manage Cookies. If you opt-out, you may still see Dell ads on Dell websites and other websites, but those ads will not be customized to you by Dell or our partners.</p>
